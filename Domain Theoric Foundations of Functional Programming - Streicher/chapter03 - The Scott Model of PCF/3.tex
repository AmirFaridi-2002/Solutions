% \begin{problem}{Page 27}
%     -Prove that the evaluation map $ev:[A_1 \to A_2] \times A_1 \to A_2$ with $ev(f,a) = f(a)$ is continuous in each argument.
% \end{problem}

% \begin{solution}
%     For the first argument, fix $a \in A_1$ and let $F \subseteq [A_1 \to A_2]$ be a directed set of continuous functions. 
% By Theorem 3.5, we have $\bigsqcup F(a) = g(a) = \bigsqcup_{f \in F} f(a)$. Thus,
% $ev(\bigsqcup F, a) = g(a) = \bigsqcup_{f \in F} f(a) = \bigsqcup \{ ev(f,a) | f \in F\} $.


% Now, for the second argument, fix $f \in [A_1 \to A_2]$ and let $X \subseteq A_1$ be a directed set.
% Because $f$ is continuous, we have $f(\bigsqcup X) = \bigsqcup \{f(x) | x \in X\}$. Thus,
% $$ ev(f, \bigsqcup X) = f(\bigsqcup X) = \bigsqcup \{f(x) | x \in X\} = \bigsqcup \{ ev(f,x) | x \in X \}. $$

% Hence, $ev$ is continuous in both arguments and by Lemma 3.4, it is jointly continuous.
