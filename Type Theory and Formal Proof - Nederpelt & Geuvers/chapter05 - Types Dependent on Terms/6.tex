\begin{problem}{5.6}
    Prove that $(A \Rightarrow (A \Rightarrow B)) \Rightarrow (A \Rightarrow B)$ is a tautology, (first) in natural deduction and (second) by means of a shortened $\lambda P$-derivation.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    One can easily show that the following has the disired type:
    $$  (\lambda f : (A\to (A\to B)).\;(\lambda a : A.\;((f\ a)\ a))) : (A\to(A\to B)) \to (A\to B) $$
\end{solution}
