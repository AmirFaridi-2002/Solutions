\begin{problem}{1.17}    
Prove the following: if \(MN\) is strongly normalising, then both \(M\) and \(N\) are strongly normalising.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    If $M$ had an infinite reduction path, let's say $M \to_\beta M_1 \to_\beta ...$, then we would have the following reduction path:
        $ MN \to_\beta M_1N \to_\beta M_2N \to_\beta ...$, but this is a contradiction since $MN$ is strongly normalising. Same goes for the case if $N$ had an infinite reduction path.
\end{solution}
