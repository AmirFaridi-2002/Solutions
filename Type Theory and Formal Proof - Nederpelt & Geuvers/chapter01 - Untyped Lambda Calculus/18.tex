\begin{problem}{1.18}
    Let \(L\), \(M\) and \(N\) be \(\lambda\)-terms such that \(L =_{\beta} M\) and \(L \twoheadrightarrow_{\beta} N\). Moreover, let \(N\) be in \(\beta\)-normal form. Prove that also \(M \twoheadrightarrow_{\beta} N\).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    Since $M =_\beta L$, then by corollary 1.9.9, there is an $X$ such that $M \twoheadrightarrow_\beta X$ and $L \twoheadrightarrow_\beta X$. By Church-Rosser Theorem, since $L \twoheadrightarrow X$ and $L \twoheadleftarrow N$, 
        there is some $Y$ such that $N \twoheadrightarrow_\beta Y$ and $X \twoheadrightarrow_\beta Y$, but $N$ is in $\beta-nf$ and hence, $N \equiv Y$.
        Now, we have $M \twoheadrightarrow_\beta X \twoheadrightarrow_\beta N$ and by the transitivity of $\twoheadrightarrow_\beta$, we have $M \twoheadrightarrow_\beta N$.
\end{solution}
