\begin{problem}{2.17}
     Prove Lemma 2.10.9 (the 'Uniqueness of Types Lemma').
    
    (Hint: use Lemma 2.10.7 (the `Generation Lemma')).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Var:} Assume $x:\sigma \in \Gamma$ and $x:\tau \in \Gamma$ (By the Generation lemma). By the definition of context (a list of declarations with different subjects), we must have $x:\sigma \equiv x:\tau$, and hence, $\sigma \equiv \tau$.
        \item \textbf{App. and Abs:} It is straightforward to assume two types for the derivations by Generation lemma, and then use IH to conclude the equivalences of the types! 
    \end{itemize}
\end{solution}
