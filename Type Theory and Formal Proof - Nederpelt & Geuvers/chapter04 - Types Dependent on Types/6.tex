\begin{problem}{4.6}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=$(\alph*)$]
    \item Prove that there are no $\Gamma$ and $N$ in $\lambda\omega$ such that $\Gamma \vdash \square : N$ is derivable.
    \item Prove that there are no $\Gamma, M$ and $N$ in $\lambda\omega$ such that $\Gamma \vdash M \rightarrow \square : N$ is derivable.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \textbf{(a.)} 

    \textbf{(b.)} Proof by induction on the structure of the derivatiov tree of the judgement $\Gamma \vdash M \to \square : N$.
    The last step in the derivation can only have been (weak.), (form.), or (conv.).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{(weak.):} First premiss must have been of the form $\Gamma' \vdash M \to \square : N$. By induction this is not derivable.
        \item \textbf{(form.):} Second premiss must have been $\Gamma \vdash \square : N$. This is not derivable by Exercise 4.6(a).
        \item \textbf{(conv.):} First premiss must have been $\Gamma \vdash M \to \square : L$. By induction this is not derivable.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus, $\Gamma \vdash M \to \square : N$ is not derivable.
\end{solution}
