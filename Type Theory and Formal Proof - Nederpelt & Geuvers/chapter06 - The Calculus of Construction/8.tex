\begin{problem}{6.8}
     \begin{enumerate}[label=$(\alph*)$]
    \item Let $\Gamma \equiv S : *, P : S \rightarrow *$. Find an inhabitant of the following type $N$ in context $\Gamma$, and prove your answer by means of a shortened derivation:
        $$N \equiv [\Pi \alpha : * . (( \Pi x : S . (P x \rightarrow \alpha)) \rightarrow \alpha)] \rightarrow [\Pi x : S . (P x \rightarrow \bot)] \rightarrow \bot.$$
    \item Which is the smallest system in the $\lambda$-cube in which your derivation may be executed?
    \item The expression $\Pi \alpha : * . (( \Pi x : S . (P x \rightarrow \alpha)) \rightarrow \alpha$ may be considered as an encoding of $\exists_{x \in S} (P(x))$. (We shall show this in Section 7.5.) In Section 7.1 we make plausible that $A \rightarrow \bot$ may be considered as an encoding of the negation $\neg A$. With these things in mind, how can we interpret the content of the expression $N$? (See also Figure 5.2.)
