\begin{problem}{6.2}
    Let $\Gamma \equiv S : *, \, P : S \rightarrow *, \, A : *$. Prove by means of a flag derivation that the following expression is inhabited in $\lambda C$ with respect to $\Gamma$:
    $$(\Pi x : S . (A \rightarrow P x)) \rightarrow A \rightarrow \Pi y : S . P y.$$
    (You may shorten the derivation, as explained in Section 4.5.)
